# hackathonProject
Nutrition Game focused towards younger children, educating how to have a healthy diet.

This game is in place to educate children and to prevent future obesity.
Obesity can start at a very young age and can be slowed or prevented by having a healthy diet.
Thus, we made this project to benefit the overall health and wellness of society in the future.
